#Master Thesis Proposal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Current Progress
- Na&iuml;ve SVM with RBF kernel: 25%
- linear SVM: train = 94%, val = 18% (overfitting, parameter-tuning needed)
- alexnet: 11000 iterations with top-1 accuracy = 48%
- possible method:
    - convolution neural network: need to survey network design
    - hand-crafted features with SVM
        - implementing patch based algorithm

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Problem
- No baseline source code, I need to implement from scratch
- Baseline CNN is slow, I'm afraid it may not converge in time.
- GTX 970 ?

##Motivation
Daily diet gains more and more attention nowaday. 
However, Most of automatic food image identification systems still 
suffer from overfitting and low accuracy, 
while self-report-based systems need extra care to get regular record. 
Thus, an accurate automatic food-log system is needed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Problem Description
Given a dataset with labeled food images, 
propose a system to identify food catagory of unknown images, 
and evaluate proposed system with top-1 (and top-5 accuracy, if possible).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##Expected Result
- Achieve 50% ~ 65% of top-1 accuracy on "50data" or "food101"
- Reduce the classification computational complextiy to acceptable level.
